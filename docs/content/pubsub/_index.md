# Twitch PubSub

PubSub enables you to subscribe to a topic, for updates (e.g., when a user cheers on a channel).

The Twitch PubSub system allows back-end services to broadcast realtime messages to clients. Example applications include:

* An instant messaging service sending instant messages between friends.
* A back-end video system pushing real-time viewer count updates to video players.
* A presence system broadcasting usersâ€™ online status to all their friends.

## As Module: Twitch4J

To use PubSub you need to enable the PubSub when building the Twitch4J Instance, as shown below:

```java
TwitchClient twitchClient = TwitchClientBuilder.builder()
	...
	.withEnablePubSub(true)
	...
	.build();
```

## Standalone

Initialize the PubSub as Standalone Module:

```java
TwitchPubSub client = TwitchPubSubBuilder.builder().build();
```

## Handle the Results

Messages received over PubSub will be dispatched using the EventManager, please see the Twitch4J -> Events Documentation on how to listen for events or check out the individual pages below for specific code samples.

## Available Topics

In PubSub Context you subscribe to topics, a topic is for example `whispers to user twitch4j` or `subscriptions in channel twitch4j`.

Note that nearly all of the pubsub topics rely upon the user ID to subscribe to them, rather than the user name. See API - Helix -> Users Get, if one needs to convert between the two.

Here is a list of available topics along with code samples:

### Official

- [Bits Badge Unlocks](./topic-bits-badge-unlocks)
- [Bits Events](./topic-bits-events)
- [Channel Points Events](./topic-channel-points-events)
- [Commerce Events (Deprecated)](./topic-commerce-events)
- [Moderation Events](./topic-moderation-events)
- [Subscribe Events](./topic-subscribe-events)
- [Whispers](./topic-whispers)

### Unofficial

Disclaimer: Use at your own risk after understanding the [Twitch Developer Agreement](https://twitch.tv/p/legal/developer-agreement).
These topics may break at any time and there is no guarantee of support.
The authors of the Twitch4J library assume no responsibility for your actions.

- [Following Events](./topic-following-events)
- [Friendship Events](./topic-friendship-events)
- [Hype Train Events](./topic-hype-train-events)
- [Hype Train Rewards](./topic-hype-train-rewards)
- [Leaderboard Events](./topic-leaderboard-events)
- [Onsite Notifications](./topic-onsite-notifications)
- [Poll Events](./topic-poll-events)
- [Presence Events](./topic-presence-events)
- [Public Cheer Events](./topic-public-cheer-events)
- [Raid Events](./topic-raid-events)
- [Sub Gift Events](./topic-sub-gift-events)
- [User Community Points Events](./topic-user-community-points-events)
- [Video Playback Events](./topic-video-playback-events)

We hope Twitch will document these topics as there is no official way to get much of this data, and they could be used for creating powerful integrations.

## Unsubscribing

Once a topic is no longer relevant, one can unsubscribe from it to stop receiving further events of that type.

```java
// Initial subscription
PubSubSubscription subscription = twitchClient.getPubSub().listenForWhisperEvents(credential, userId);

// Later unsubscription
twitchClient.getPubSub().unsubscribeFromTopic(subscription);
```

## Rate-limits

A single `TwitchPubSub` instance may only be subscribed to up to 50 topics at a time, under Twitch's [default limits](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/pubsub#api-limits).
This yields another reason to unsubscribe from irrelevant topics; it creates headroom for other topics.

If still more headroom is needed, one can construct additional `TwitchPubSub` instances, each with a limit of 50 topics.
Twitch _recommends_ no greater than 10 pubsub connections be made from a single IP (each `TwitchPubSub` instance is equivalent to a single connection), but this is not a hard limit.
